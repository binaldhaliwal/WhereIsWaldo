# WhereIsWaldo

This program is used as a driver program to play the game from the class WhereIsWaldo. Our friend Waldo is hiding in an auditorium seat represented in the class, WhereIsWaldo. Two players will take turns searching the seats of the auditorium by selecting a row and a seat where the Waldo might be.
